CS330 Comp Graphic and Visualization

How do I approach designing software? 
   Learning OpenGL and 3D graphics rendering was very rewarding yet challenging. Through this API, I was able to comprehend and take advantage of specific graphics hardware. Approaching this sort of learning platform had to be systematic, like any other platform, for the educational journey to be efficient. Starting with the basics and 2D I was able to work through rendering on a 2D plane with basic shapes. Drawing a basic triangle allowed for fundamentals on vertices, vertex buffer objects, and vertex array objects, with a brief introduction to shaders. This made the way for future tactics and allowed me to render 3D objects and call various classes such as the cylinder and sphere class. 
   
How do I approach developing programs?
   The approach I took on developing this program, specifically the 3D scene of my coffee table was done with modularity and logical partitioning in mind. The strategy was based on having several smaller parts and portions of code that serve minor functions yet combine to provide the purpose of the program. The usage of VBO and VAO’s allowed for necessary iteration. Along with ability of looping the various textures in with the different objects, the 3D scene came together just as it should have. The individual milestones kept necessary progress moving with small advances in learning such as shaders, lighting, and texturing. This was beneficial throughout the course as the final project was just a polishing of the milestones towards the end. 
   
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
   Through this course and others, I now have a stronger understanding of the 2D/3D graphics rending process and what it entails. These newly found skills are a launching point into more complex projects I could take on in the future and be capable of completing. An additional and necessary tool for my toolbox to create and learn. From an educational standpoint, I feel that I have only brushed the top of the learning process with this course. The possibilities are endless and left to the imagination with OpenGL and the things I could render and learn. The same goes from a future professional pathway. From game design/development to even web or app design.There are multiple potentials that come from the base knowledge learned in this course. 


CS340 Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
   Initially, I ensure proper naming with respect to classes and variables. The method should be fully understandable from the name. Attempts are also made to ensure methods and code are not repeated but rather grouped into a single method. Comments are necessary for explanations and commented out code is deleted to reduce clutter. There are several advantages to connecting the CRUD module and dashboard widgets to the database. Easy performance checks are utilized through testing and a quick glance at useful functionality and accessibility can take place if needed. The CRUD Python module could be very useful in expanding the entire program to meet other needs. It could additionally be used as a template for other similar programs not limited to an AnimalShelter database. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
   The problem was approached from a systematic point of view with respect to understanding, design, implementation, and testing. Different from previous assignments, this project required substantial thought in that the time constraints and amount of planning made it more difficult. This was a multilevel assignment that questioned and checked knowledge from previous courses along with the current set of assignments. The techniques and strategies learned and implemented in Mongodb will be carried into future assignments specifically in the work place. This set of assignments created a launching off point needed to continue learning the material.  

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
   A computer scientist has many potential roles but generally speaking uses technology to solve issues with a primary focus of validating and developing models for interaction between a person and a computer. This focus is very important due to the fact that close attention to detail is necessary for programming and a human component is required to bridge the gap between the computer and user. The dashboard created for Grazioso Salvare bridges this gap between computer and user allowing minimal amount of time and money to be spent on training an employee to query and/or search/update information based on the animal shelter project. 



CS320 Software Test Automation & QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 In ensuring my code is technically sound I need to be aware of bugs and/or errors which might crash the program. It also means using JUnit tests to experiment with what code follows the exact set requirements. I am able to make sure the proper portions of code interact with the necessary counterparts.  Coverage is a very useful tool in determining how effective the JUnit tests are. In running the coverage of my code I was able to ascertain which statements were executed in the test case and which ones were not. For the contact class coverage, 100% was covered so the test cases I coded were exercised when those specific tests were run. The green highlighted portions mean the line of code has been covered by the test. The yellow highlighted portions indicates that not all the branches in that particular code have been reached, and the red highlighted portions show that line of code has not been reached or covered in the JUnit.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  While challenging, quite a bit was learned in coding the contact service. I formatted my testing approach in a way that verified the specific requirements of each service were separately met. This was no easy task as the requirements were particular so the tests must be particular as well. In the case of JUnit testing, it was necessary to make the tests repeatable. Test cases were written calling the different methods reflecting and aligning with the requirements. By asserting the return value against the expected value, the test case verifies certain parameters.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  There were a few techniques I was able to recognize and utilize to complete the testing for the various requirements. Of the testing techniques, specification-based, structure-based, and experience-based, I seem to be using white-box or structure-based testing with JUnit. With this process, the various elements of the structure are exercised to ensure their correct operation. I used the process of decide on a test condition, design a test case to verify the specific condition, and write a test procedure to execute the test. Utilizing the white-box technique allowed me to further incorporate characteristics of the stages of this process and uncover errors or issues in the code. Using the coverage tool allowed me to verify which lines of code were functional and which parts of the code were actually tested and to what extent. I feel that I wrote meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes with clear intent that were self-explanatory. It is important not to cut corners because you do not want a poor reputation or to be known for rushing requirements. For these requirements I used explicit naming for what the function of the class actually does such as contact, appointment, and task along with packaging all of the tests together for ease of use and locating. In addition to proper naming and location of classes and files, I avoided anonymous functions that might be difficult to go back and understand. While this was a relatively simple structure, I feel that the processes and tools used managed things with minimal complexity.  




CS250 Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are necessary for creating a quality product and understanding the desires and overall focus of the project. They are interpreted and implemented through user stories 
  which prioritize development tasks. This adds to the overall order of operation of the program. Creating the user story increases understanding of various capability requests 
  from the user or customer and, in turn, increases understanding of the sought after features while increasing end user's perspective. 


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  My approach to developing programs is much like baking a cake or any sort of systematic process except with more of an agile methodology. While baking a cake remains much like a 
  waterfall method in that it is difficult to reverse order once certain steps are performed, the planning and estimation holds value in that everything must be planned out from 
  the start with respect to ingredients. In development, specifically involving a customer base, an agile method is almost necessary to a high value product and end result due to 
  its flexibility and customer involvement. I would hope to incorporate agile processes into my future development such as incorporation of cross functional and self organizing 
  teams through a collaborative effort. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development carries a few factors that many career fields and goal oriented aspiriations possess. Specifically, being a good member of a
  Scrum Team entails being prepared for your role and knowledgeable of its various operations. Respect, open communication, and transparency also play a major part in any group 
  setting as it involves many different personalities working toward a common goal of a high value and efficient product.
