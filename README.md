How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 In ensuring my code is technically sound I need to be aware of bugs and/or errors which might crash the program. It also means using JUnit tests to experiment with what code follows the exact set requirements. I am able to make sure the proper portions of code interact with the necessary counterparts.  Coverage is a very useful tool in determining how effective the JUnit tests are. In running the coverage of my code I was able to ascertain which statements were executed in the test case and which ones were not. For the contact class coverage, 100% was covered so the test cases I coded were exercised when those specific tests were run. The green highlighted portions mean the line of code has been covered by the test. The yellow highlighted portions indicates that not all the branches in that particular code have been reached, and the red highlighted portions show that line of code has not been reached or covered in the JUnit.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  While challenging, quite a bit was learned in coding the contact service. I formatted my testing approach in a way that verified the specific requirements of each service were separately met. This was no easy task as the requirements were particular so the tests must be particular as well. In the case of JUnit testing, it was necessary to make the tests repeatable. Test cases were written calling the different methods reflecting and aligning with the requirements. By asserting the return value against the expected value, the test case verifies certain parameters.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  There were a few techniques I was able to recognize and utilize to complete the testing for the various requirements. Of the testing techniques, specification-based, structure-based, and experience-based, I seem to be using white-box or structure-based testing with JUnit. With this process, the various elements of the structure are exercised to ensure their correct operation. I used the process of decide on a test condition, design a test case to verify the specific condition, and write a test procedure to execute the test. Utilizing the white-box technique allowed me to further incorporate characteristics of the stages of this process and uncover errors or issues in the code. Using the coverage tool allowed me to verify which lines of code were functional and which parts of the code were actually tested and to what extent. I feel that I wrote meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes with clear intent that were self-explanatory. It is important not to cut corners because you do not want a poor reputation or to be known for rushing requirements. For these requirements I used explicit naming for what the function of the class actually does such as contact, appointment, and task along with packaging all of the tests together for ease of use and locating. In addition to proper naming and location of classes and files, I avoided anonymous functions that might be difficult to go back and understand. While this was a relatively simple structure, I feel that the processes and tools used managed things with minimal complexity.  




CS250 Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are necessary for creating a quality product and understanding the desires and overall focus of the project. They are interpreted and implemented through user stories 
  which prioritize development tasks. This adds to the overall order of operation of the program. Creating the user story increases understanding of various capability requests 
  from the user or customer and, in turn, increases understanding of the sought after features while increasing end user's perspective. 


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  My approach to developing programs is much like baking a cake or any sort of systematic process except with more of an agile methodology. While baking a cake remains much like a 
  waterfall method in that it is difficult to reverse order once certain steps are performed, the planning and estimation holds value in that everything must be planned out from 
  the start with respect to ingredients. In development, specifically involving a customer base, an agile method is almost necessary to a high value product and end result due to 
  its flexibility and customer involvement. I would hope to incorporate agile processes into my future development such as incorporation of cross functional and self organizing 
  teams through a collaborative effort. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development carries a few factors that many career fields and goal oriented aspiriations possess. Specifically, being a good member of a
  Scrum Team entails being prepared for your role and knowledgeable of its various operations. Respect, open communication, and transparency also play a major part in any group 
  setting as it involves many different personalities working toward a common goal of a high value and efficient product.
