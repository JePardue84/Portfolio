How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are necessary for creating a quality product and understanding the desires and overall focus of the project. They are interpreted and implemented through user stories 
  which prioritize development tasks. This adds to the overall order of operation of the program. Creating the user story increases understanding of various capability requests 
  from the user or customer and, in turn, increases understanding of the sought after features while increasing end user's perspective. 


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  My approach to developing programs is much like baking a cake or any sort of systematic process except with more of an agile methodology. While baking a cake remains much like a 
  waterfall method in that it is difficult to reverse order once certain steps are performed, the planning and estimation holds value in that everything must be planned out from 
  the start with respect to ingredients. In development, specifically involving a customer base, an agile method is almost necessary to a high value product and end result due to 
  its flexibility and customer involvement. I would hope to incorporate agile processes into my future development such as incorporation of cross functional and self organizing 
  teams through a collaborative effort.
